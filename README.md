You use this web application to find the tints of a given color.
on the left of the base(color the you've entered) you'll see the lighter colors of the base 
lightened by 10% on the right of the base you'll see the darker colors darkened by 10%.
In order to the input to be valid you should enter a valid hexadecimal color that consists of a '#' in addition to 3 symbols or 6 otherwise the input border will change into red. which means an invalid input.
By default #F15025 color will be displayed with its brighter and darker colors.
